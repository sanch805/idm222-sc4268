- About Persephone Books
'The nearest thing British publishing has to a cult' (Observer)

Persephone Books published its first title in the spring of 1999. Founder Nicola Beauman’s original concept was to re-print a handful of 'lost' or out-of-print books every year, most of them interwar novels by women. The name Persephone was chosen as a symbol of female creativity, as well as of new beginnings (the daughter of Zeus is associated with spring).

The founder of Persephone Books, Nicola Beauman (née Mann), was born in 1944, brought up in London, and read English at Newnham College, Cambridge. She is the author of A Very Great Profession: The Woman’s Novel 1914 39 (1983), Cynthia Asquith (1987), Morgan: a biography of E.M. Forster (1993) and The Other Elizabeth Taylor (2009). She is married with five children and eight grand-children and lives in London and Bath. She likes brogues, daffodils and madeira. Our books cost £14 each in the UK. We sell them mainly via our website, but they are also available in the Persephone bookshop and through a few other bookshops too.
