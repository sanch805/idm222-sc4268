            Persephone Books published its first title in the spring of 1999. Founder Nicola
            Beauman's original concept was to re-print a handful of 'lost' or out-of-print books
            every year, most of them interwar novels by women. The name Persephone was chosen
            as a symbol of female creativity, as well as new beginnings (the daughter of Ceres is
            associated with spring).

            The founder of Persephone Books, <em>Nicola Beauman</em> (née Mann), was born in 1944,
            brought up in London, and read English at Newnham College, Cambridge. She is the
            author of <span class="book-title">A Very Great Profession</span>: The Woman's Novel 1914-39 (1983), 
            Cynthia Asquith (1987), Morgan: a biography of E.M. Forster (1993) and The Other
            Elizabeth Taylor (2009). She is married with five children and eight grand-children
            and lives in London and Bath. She likes brogues, daffodils and madeira. Our books
            cost £14 each in the UK. We sell them mainly via our website, but they are also
            available in the Persephone bookshop and through a few other bookshops too. For
            other practical matters, have a look at our Frequently Asked Questions.
