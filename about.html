    <p> 'The nearest thing British publishing has to a cult' (Observer)</p>
    <p>Persephone Books published its first title in the spring of 1999. Founder Nicola Beauman's original concept was to re-print a handful of 'lost' or out-of-print books every year, most of them interwar novels by women. The name Persephone was chosen as a symbol of female creativity, as well as new beginnings (the daughter of Ceres is associated with spring).
    </p>
    <p>The founder of Persephone Books, <em>Nicola Beauman</em> (née Mann), was born in 1944, brought up in London, and read English at Newnham College, Cambridge. She is the author of <span class="book-title">A Very Great Profession</span>: The Woman's Novel 1914-39 (1983), Cynthia Asquith (1987), Morgan: a biography of E.M. Forster (1993) and The Other Elizabeth Taylor (2009). She is married with five children and eight grand-children and lives in London and Bath. She likes brogues, daffodils and madeira. Our books cost £14 each in the UK. We sell them mainly via our website, but they are also available in the Persephone bookshop and through a few other bookshops too.
